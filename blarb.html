  <p>How this all came to be</p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>Mental illnesses have always run in my family and I constantly see people struggling with it. Seeing this my whole life, I know how important of an issue this is. To me, this project is very important.</p>
      <p>So many people struggle with mental health issues. As a teenager, I've seen peers go through it and even myself has struggled with mental health. In times likes this, sometimes all a person needs is someone to talk to.</p>

      <h3>How?</h3>
      <p>My vision was to create an AI model with characteristics of emotions and sensitivity to talk to that would have the looks of a small pet. This would help the person find the AI bot more easy to talk to. I also planned to eventually convert this into an app for easier use.</p>
      <p>This is a hackathon and not everything can be programmed in one day. I programmed the key parts of what I wanted in this project. This has the potential to go far and I would like to develop it further given the chance!</p>
      <p>Due to an efficiency constraint, I used OpenAI's Marv bot and pulled it as an API. This took many hours to figure out due t0 the inconsistency of converting a Curl file into Javascript and trying to send data back to the source. With the time left, I designed the html of the website, incorporating Bootstrap 5. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>What after?</h3>
      <p>I plan to more thoroughly develop this till around June and expiriment with fine-tuning Ghat GPT when the API gets released. I also will work on a graphic 3d model to make this bot more visually appealing and easy to talk to!</p>
      <p>At one point, I may request OpenAI for publishing the app and seeing how I can improve it after that!</p>
